Projectile Sim is now WAY Better and Stable

I just rebuilt the Projectile Simulator. The old version was acting super weird and laggy on a bunch of devices (sorry about that!), so I totally rebuilt the core code to be more reliable and run smoothly everywhere.

The New Good Stuff:

1. No More Lag or Crashing (Super Stable)
2. Gravity is Locked In (g = 9.8 m/s²)
3. Added a Realistic 'Wobble'
